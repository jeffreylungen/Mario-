# Super Mario World Rank Adventure

This project creates a small **story mode progression system** inspired by classic Mario vibes:

- 2 main characters (`Mario` and `Luigi`)
- Multiple worlds with escalating difficulty
- Levels in each world with rank points
- Rank-up progression while finishing levels and beating the game

## Story Mode

The Mushroom Kingdom has been split into challenge zones. Mario and Luigi must clear each world, collect rank points, and rise from Rookie heroes to Legendary protectors.

## Worlds

1. Grassland Gateway
2. Desert Dunes
3. Ice Mountain
4. Forest Fortress
5. Sky Kingdom
6. Lava Castle (final world)

## Character Ranks

- Rookie
- Bronze
- Silver
- Gold
- Platinum
- Legendary

## Run

```bash
python3 game_progression.py
```

This prints each character's journey world-by-world and level-by-level, plus final ranks.
